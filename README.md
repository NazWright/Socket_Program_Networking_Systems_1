Problem

	You will write a simple application that requires a server to try and guess a number random integer
	generated by a client. The client will send the maximum possible value and the number of guesses to
	the server. The server will then try to iteratively guess the number based on feedback from the client.
	Note: In most cases the server will have less than log2n guesses. Your grade will not be based on
	whether you do any clever AI on your server.
	Protocol:
	
	The client will connect with the server and send two integer values with consecutive writeInt() calls. The
	first value will be the maximum value and the second value will be the number of guesses. The server
	will make a guess at the value and send the guess back to the client. The client will output the guess
	made by the server and respond to the server with the integer -1 (the guess was too low), 1 (the guess
	was too high) and 0 the guess was correct. This process continues until the guess is correct or the
	maximum guesses is reached. After the client sends the last response to the server, the client outputs
	the secret number and if the number was guessed. You should pass the maximum value, the number of
	guesses, server IP and server port as command line arguments to the client.
	
	Deliverables:
	Upload your documented Client.java and Server.java source files. Each should have its own main()
	method.
